# Changelog — Pantomime Paradox

## 1.3.1
### Added / Updated
- Config menu layout: multiple columns for better readability.
- New optional vanilla Joker scaling buffs (each has its own toggle):
  - Misprint (max by Ante)
  - Hiker (by Ante)
  - Suit Jokers (by Ante)
  - Hand Jokers (base scaling by Ante)
  - Half Joker (by Ante)
  - Banner (by Round)
  - Mystic Summit (by Ante)
  - Additional optional buffs (Scary Face, Fibonacci, Scholar, Abstract, Even Steven, Odd Todd, To Do List, Smiley Face, Walkie Talkie, Castle, Rough Gem, Arrowhead, Onyx Agate, Bootstraps, Bull, Runner)
  - Splash: optional 5-card bonus chips in scoring context
- New Run UI: improved injection logic so toggles can **merge** with other UI mods (e.g. Partner / Galdur Compat).
- Main content master toggle (separate from the columns): enables/disables main mod content (**restart required**).

### Fixes
- Magical Edition tag gain sound behavior adjusted (uses the same sound approach as Boon).
